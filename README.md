---

Ever found yourself waiting at a station, wondering exactly where your train is? **Train Tracker** is a modern, user-focused application designed to demystify your journey on the Bangladesh Railway. It moves beyond static schedules to provide a live, dynamic, and predictive tracking experience, helping you plan your travel with confidence and peace of mind.

This application is built to be your reliable companion, whether you're a daily commuter or a long-distance traveler. Our mission is to make your rail travel stress-free by giving you the most accurate and up-to-date information, right at your fingertips.

## ✨ Key Features for Your Journey

We've packed Train Tracker with powerful features designed to give you a complete picture of your journey from start to finish.

### 🚆 Live Train Tracking
Don't just guess, *see*. Our main tracking screen provides a rich, at-a-glance view of your train's current status.

* **Real-Time Progress:** When a train is en route between stations, a dynamic progress bar shows its real-time headway, so you can visualize its journey.
* **At-Station Status:** As soon as your train arrives at a station, its status updates to "At Station," complete with a 5-minute departure countdown.
* **Turnaround Visibility:** No more confusion at the end of a line. We clearly show when a train is "At Turnaround," so you know exactly when it's preparing for its return journey.
* **Journey Complete:** Once a train has finished its full route for the day, its status will clearly show "Journey Completed."

### 🧠 Smart Predictive ETAs
This is where Train Tracker truly shines. Our system is smarter than a static timetable.

* **Data-Driven Predictions:** Our system analyzes the train's 7-day travel history to calculate a dynamic, **average-based ETA** for every upcoming stop on the route.
* **Intelligent Fallback:** If a train has insufficient historical data (e.g., it's a new route), our system intelligently falls back to the official schedule, ensuring you always have a reliable estimate.
* **Late Train Alerts:** The system monitors the train's progress against its predicted arrival. If a train is running significantly late, a warning will appear so you can adjust your plans.

### 🚉 Comprehensive Station Status
Know exactly what's happening at any station in the network, not just the one you're at.

* **Search All Stations:** A clean, searchable list of all stations in the Bangladesh Railway network.
* **Live Station Dashboard:** Select any station to see a live dashboard of activity.
* **Arrived Now:** Instantly see which trains are "On Platform" right now.
* **Arriving Next:** View a list of all trains that are currently en route and scheduled to arrive next.
* **Map Integration:** Get your bearings with a quick link to view the station's location on a map.

### 👤 A Personalized Experience
Your journey, your app.

* **User Accounts:** By creating a free account, you unlock the full power of the app.
* **Personalized Home:** Your personal dashboard welcomes you with a time-based greeting (e.g., "Let's start a fresh journey.") and provides one-tap access to find your train or station.
* **Guided Onboarding:** A beautiful, one-time onboarding process introduces you to the app's most powerful features.

### 🗺️ Easy Route & Train Discovery
Finding your train has never been simpler.

* **Filter by Route:** You don't need to know a train's specific name or code. Simply select your route (e.g., "Dhaka - Chattogram") to see a complete list of all trains running on that line.
* **Clear Information:** Each train in the list shows its name, code, and current high-level status, helping you choose the right one.

### 💬 We Value Your Feedback
